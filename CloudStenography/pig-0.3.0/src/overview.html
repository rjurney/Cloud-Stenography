Pig is a platform for a data flow programming on large data sets in a parallel
environment.  It consists of a language to specify these programs, 
<a href="http://wiki.apache.org/pig/PigLatin">Pig Latin</a>,
a compiler for this language, and an execution engine to execute the programs.
<p>
Pig currently runs on the <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/core/">hadoop</a>
platform, reading data from and writing data to hdfs, and doing processing via
one or more map-reduce jobs.

<h2> Design </h2>
This section gives a very high overview of the design of the Pig system.  
Throughout the documents you can see design for that package or class by 
looking for the Design heading in the documentation.

<h3> Overview </h3>
<p>
Pig's design is guided by our <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/pig/philosophy.html">
pig philosophy</a> and by our experience with similar data processing 
systems.
<p>
Pig shares many similarities with a traditional RDBMS design.  It has a parser,
type checker, optimizer, and operators that perform the data processing.  However,
there are some 
significant differences.  Pig does not have a data catalog, there are no
transactions, pig does not directly manage data storage, nor does it implement the 
execution framework.
<p>
<h3> High Level Architecture </h3>
Pig is split between the front and back ends of the engine.  The front end handles
parsing, checking, and doing initial optimization on a Pig Latin script.  The
result is a {@link org.apache.pig.impl.logicalLayer.LogicalPlan} that defines how
the script will be executed.
<p>
Once a LogicalPlan has been generated, the backend of Pig handles executing the
script.  Pig supports multiple different
backend implementations, in order to allow Pig to run on different systems.  
Currently pig comes with two backends, Map-Reduce and local.  For a given run,
pig selects the backend to use via configuration.
